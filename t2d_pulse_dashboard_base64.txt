The t2d_pulse_dashboard.zip file has been created and is ready for download from the Replit Files menu. It contains:

1. All Python files for the dashboard (app.py and related modules)
2. All JavaScript files in the assets folder for client-side fixes
3. Backup versions of the code (app.py.old, app.py.fix)
4. Additional assets and resources

To fix the weight update issue:
1. The issue is with the duplicate callback outputs in the app.py file
2. Use the app.py.old file to restore the working version
3. The enhanced JavaScript solution in assets/weight-updater-enhanced.js will improve the UI feedback without modifying server callbacks

Instructions to restore from the zip:
1. Download the t2d_pulse_dashboard.zip file from Replit
2. Examine the fix files to understand the issue
3. Replace app.py with app.py.old if needed
4. Restart the Economic Dashboard Server workflow

The dashboard is currently running in a restored state. To implement the client-side fix:
1. Keep using the JavaScript enhancements (weight-updater-enhanced.js)
2. Avoid modifying the callback structure in app.py
3. If needed, make targeted fixes to specific callbacks

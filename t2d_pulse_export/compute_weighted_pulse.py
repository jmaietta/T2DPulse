# compute_weighted_pulse.py
# -------------------------------------------
# Rebuild the full T2D Pulse history by:
# 1) Aggregating stock-level sentiment (20-day EMA of returns) into sector-level sentiment via market-cap weighting
# 2) Computing the overall Pulse as the simple average of the 14 sector sentiment scores per day
# All data flows through Postgresâ€”no CSVs.

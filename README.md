# T2D Pulse Dashboard

## Tooltip Implementation Solution

We've identified and solved the tooltip issue in the T2D Pulse dashboard. The core problem was that the original tooltip implementation was using a syntax with unclosed brackets that caused JavaScript errors.

### Solution Approach

We've created a pure CSS hover-based tooltip solution that:

1. Uses simple HTML structure with proper CSS classes
2. Requires no JavaScript or Dash callbacks
3. Shows/hides the tooltip based on hover state
4. Has smooth transitions and proper positioning

### Implementation Files

1. **CSS Implementation**: `assets/tooltip.css` and `assets/pure_css_tooltip.css`
   - These files contain the CSS rules that handle the hover behavior and styling

2. **Example Implementation**: `tooltip_only.py` and `final_tooltip_solution.py`
   - Minimal examples showing how to structure the HTML for tooltips

3. **Fixed Dashboard**: `app_fixed.py`
   - A corrected version of the main app with proper tooltip implementation

### How It Works

The tooltip is implemented with this HTML structure:

```html
<div class="tooltip-wrapper">
  <span class="tooltip-icon">â“˜</span>
  <div class="tooltip-content">
    Tooltip content goes here
  </div>
</div>
```

And uses these CSS rules to show/hide based on hover:

```css
.tooltip-wrapper {
  position: relative;
  display: inline-block;
  cursor: pointer;
}

.tooltip-wrapper .tooltip-content {
  visibility: hidden;
  opacity: 0;
  transition: opacity 0.3s;
  /* Positioning rules */
}

.tooltip-wrapper:hover .tooltip-content {
  visibility: visible;
  opacity: 1;
}
```

### Integration Steps

To integrate this solution into the main dashboard:

1. Ensure the CSS file is in the assets folder
2. Use the HTML structure shown above where tooltips are needed
3. No additional JavaScript setup is required

This hover-based approach is more reliable than the previous implementation and provides a better user experience with smooth transitions.
